# Load one WSF Evolution tile (local)
wsf_file <- '/Documents/priogrid/World Settlement Footprint Evolution/updated 2025/f52c5d59-8867-4b5b-8504-bcc6dcf6839d/WSFevolution_v1_-76_40.tif'
wsf <- rast(wsf_file)

1. There are still missing (empty) tiles in the download
- we previously downloaded in bins of 2 (we will have to download 1 at a time in order to retrieve all tiles)
- an example of missing data is displayed above (U.S. east coast)
- another example is southern nigeria

*How did we overcome this previously with Jonas?
  A) we updated the URL list in the inst/url directory
  B) then do we 're-load' the data source?

2. Processing speed is very slow

- We cannot generate a global mosaic
  * Warning: [mosaic] Estimated disk space needed without compression: 591GB. Available: 75 GB.Error: [mosaic] aborted
- Therefore we must loop over all tiles which will be very time consuming (and memory intensive)

3. Concerns about whether users will have to regenerate this entire process or whether they will be able to
reference a 'compiled' version?
- Are we requiring a user to go through the same script we are developing or will they be able to reference
a 'finished' ingestion?
- will a user who wants to interact with the WSF layers be required to compile the entire process themselves?
  - if now, describe how this process is referencing a 'compiled' result from the wrapper function?
