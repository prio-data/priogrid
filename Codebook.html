<h2 id="funding">Funding:</h2>
<p>PRIO-GRID was initiated by Andreas Forø Tollefsen and Halvard Buhaug in 2008. The project was an integral part of the Advanced Conflict Data Catalogue (ACDC) project (2011-2013), led by Håvard Strand, and funded by the Research Council of Norway. The upgrade to PRIO-GRID version 2.0 has been funded by the Research Council of Norway and the European Research Council through separate research project grants (#240315-F10 and #648291, respectively), led by Halvard Buhaug (PRIO).</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes the development and content of the PRIO-GRID dataset, a standardized spatial grid structure with global coverage at a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees. See Tollefsen, Strand &amp; Buhaug (2012) for additional information on the background, motivation, and application of PRIO-GRID.</p>
<p>PRIO-GRID consists of four components. The first is the tabular dataset, containing spatially disaggregated data at the grid cell level. While these tables do not contain the geometries per se, they can be represented and visualized using the PRIO-GRID geographic information systems (GIS) shapefiles, which contain the polygon grid and the corresponding cell centroids. Two .csv files are available for download; one .csv table for static variables and one .csv table for time-varying variables where the grid has one realization per calendar year. The content of the .csv files depends on the variables selected for download through the data portal.</p>
<p>The second component includes open-source replication scripts that were used to generate the PRIO-GRID dataset, publically available through the GitHub-repository at <a href="http://www.github.com/prio-data/priogrid">github.com/prio-data/priogrid</a>. These files facilitate replication, modification, and extension of the original files, including joining of additional geo-referenced data, should the user wish to do so.</p>
<p>The third component is the documentation, consisting of the journal article presenting PRIO-GRID (Tollefsen, Strand &amp; Buhaug 2012), this codebook, and the instructions for how to use the replication files at <a href="http://www.github.com/prio-data/priogrid">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The fourth component is a shapefile of the grid-cells. The shapefile is a 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degree grid system of the world. It contains both land and sea grids. When merged with the data, you can use this shapefile to plot data on a map.</p>
<p>PRIO-GRID is a versioned dataset, meaning that changes to the data are released with new version numbers. Higher version numbers indicate more recent data. All files, scripts, and documentation should reflect these version changes.</p>
<h3 id="changes-in-version-2.0">Changes in version 2.0</h3>
<p>PRIO-GRID version 2.0 introduces several updates, changes, and new additions since version 1.01. PRIO-GRID 2.0 extends the temporal coverage until 2014, providing one annual grid representation of the globe for each year, 1946-2014. While previous PRIO-GRID versions only contained grid cells occupied by independent states as defined by the Gleditsch &amp; Ward system membership list, version 2.0 contains all terrestrial cells, in total 64,818 per grid, for all years regardless of the political status of the territory. For grid cells covering non-independent territory, the country code (gwno) will be missing. This is done to facilitate inclusion of time-series data that are not associated with a country, notably climate statistics.</p>
<h4 id="list-of-changes">List of changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The data structure has been refactored for easier use. Version 2.0 consists of one static table, one yearly table, and one shapefile with the corresponding geometries. The content of the tables will be determined by the user when generating the data through the data portal.</li>
<li>Duplicates of cell-year observations (previously done to permit info on overlapping ethnic groups) have been removed. Instead, link tables, such as GeoEPR2PRIO-GRID, are provided as an extension.</li>
<li>A new interactive data portal has been created where PRIO-GRID data can be visualized, queried, and downloaded.</li>
<li>The development process has been made fully automated and replicable in a downloadable package, along with instructions for how to use. This includes converting from a mixed use of Python and SQL scripts to nearly pure SQL scripts, for less dependencies and easier replication. Any replication will require a PostGIS compatible database. The scripts used to create PRIO-GRID have been made available as open-source files through the GitHub data repository.</li>
<li>In addition to general updating of time-varying variables to cover more recent years and minor adjustments in some variable operationalizations (see data description below for details), several new indicators have been added, and some have been removed. More specifically:
<ul>
<li>The Conflict Sites and onset data featured in v.1.01 are not included in v.2.0 since the underlying Conflict Site dataset has not been updated after 2008. Please refer back to v.1.01 for these data (merge using gid-year). Note that the UCDP Georeferenced Event Data, UCDP conflict polygons, and the ACLED datasets provide links to PRIO-GRID cell IDs for each event and can thus be easily imported into the grid.</li>
<li>All distance measurements are now spherical distances, rather than geometric distances.</li>
<li>Rather than listing all GeoEPR groups within a cell, v.2.0 includes a count of <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('excluded')">excluded</a> groups within a gid-year. A new link table, GeoEPR2PRIO-GRID, is available on the PRIO-GRID web as an extension for users who want to import additional information from the EPR family datasets.</li>
<li>Globcover landuse coverages are now separated into variables (<a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('urban_gc')">urban_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('agri_gc')">agri_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('forest_gc')">forest_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('shrub_gc')">shrub_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('herb_gc')">herb_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('aquaveg_gc')">aquaveg_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('barren_gc')">barren_gc</a>, <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('water_gc')">water_gc</a>), rather than using the combination of <strong>lclass</strong> and <strong>lclasspct</strong> in PRIO-GRID v.1.01. Users wishing to aggregate their own combinations of landuse types should consult the old v.1.01.</li>
<li>Data on irrigation (<a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('irrig')">irrig</a>) is now based on a new data source that also captures changes over time.</li>
<li>Precipitation data (<a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('prec_gpcc')">prec_gpcc</a> and <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('prec_gpcp')">prec_gpcp</a>) are now derived from two alternative sources, GPCC and GPCP, rather than the University of Delaware (NOAA 2011) data provided through PRIO-GRID v.1.01.</li>
<li>Temperature data (<a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('temp')">temp</a>) are now derived from GHCN/CAMS (Fan et.al. 2008), rather than the University of Delaware (NOAA 2011) data provided through PRIO-GRID v.1.01.</li>
<li>A number of new drought measures have been added.</li>
<li>Data on the location of diamond, petroleum, gems, gold, and drugs deposits have been added.</li>
<li>Data on child malnutrition has been added (CIESIN CMR).</li>
<li>Satellite Nightlight emission data have been added (DMSP-OLS).</li>
<li>Crop and landuse data from MIRCA2000 and ISAM-HYDE have been added.</li>
<li>Population data from HYDE have been added to supplement the GPW data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-development-of-prio-grid">The development of PRIO-GRID </h3>
<p>PRIO-GRID is generated in a relational database management system (RDBMS); PostgreSQL with the spatial PostGIS extension supplying the geometric functionality of the Structured Query Language (SQL) database. PRIO-GRID is released with a 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degree cell resolution. This corresponds to a cell of roughly 55 x 55 kilometers at the Equator (3025 square kilometers area). Cell area decreases at higher latitudes due to the curvature of the earth.</p>
<p>The grid structure is defined by a south-western starting point defined by x and y coordinates (90S and 180W) and represented using the WGS84 geographic reference system. The cell identifier starts at 1 at the south-western corner (column 1 and row 1) and increases by 1 for each column, until reaching 720 (column 720 and row 1). The cell identifier then starts at the next row and begins at 721 (column 1 row 2). The full grid at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees resolution contains 259,200 cells (720 x 360). A majority of these cells cover water and other uninhabited areas (notably the Arctic and Antarctica) and are of little relevance in most applications. To limit file size, the released PRIO-GRID only includes terrestrial grid cells (64,818) although the full grid is maintained and is available on request. The current version of PRIO-GRID consists of one grid per calendar year for the period 1946–2014.</p>
<p>The remaining sections of the codebook contain a brief presentation of all variables in the PRIO-GRID files and how they were imported and modified to fit into the PRIO-GRID data structure.</p>
<h3 id="the-grid-reference-file">The Grid reference file</h3>
<p>The grid reference file contains information about the PRIO-GRID spatial data structure. This file is provided in the ESRI shapefile format, where each cell is represented by a rectangular vector geometry in addition to a shapefile containing the centroid point. Variables from the static and temporal files can be visualized and analyzed by merging data to the shapefile via the grid identifier (see below).</p>
<h3 id="adding-additional-data-using-the-provided-shapefile">Adding additional data using the provided shapefile </h2>
<p>In addition to the data available in the tables explained above, we provide a shapefile with the cell geometry that make it possible for users to add their own data. This file may be used in a GIS software to extract, join or overlay with other spatial data. The shapefile may be joined to the various attribute tables using the gid variable.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-replication-scripts">Using the replication scripts </h2>
<p>PRIO-GRID aims to be transparent and is fully replicable with a set of automated script. The necessary files and instructions can be found at the GitHub repository at <a href="http://www.github.com/prio-data/priogrid">github.com/prio-data/priogrid</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-included-data">Overview of Included Data</h2>

<h3 id="grid-cell-identifiers">Grid cell identifiers</h3>
<h4 id="gid">gid</h4>
<p>is the grid cell identifier, a unique id code for each cell in the grid. Since we only include the terrestrial cells from the full grid, the gid starts at 49182 and ends at 249344. See <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('the-development-of-prio-grid')">The development of PRIO-GRID</a> for explanation of the grid structure.</p>
<h4 id="col">col</h4>
<p>denotes column number for the grid cell. Column 1 is the westernmost column in the grid, between 180 and 179.5 decimal degrees W. With one column per half degree, there are 720 columns in PRIO-GRID.</p>
<h4 id="row">row</h4>
<p>denotes the row number for the grid cell. Row 1 is the southernmost row (between 90 and 89.5 degrees S) and row 360 is the northernmost row in the full grid in the underlying data.</p>
<h4 id="xcoord">xcoord</h4>
<p>denotes the longitude coordinate (decimal degrees) for the centroid of the grid cell. Negative coordinates are located west of the Prime Meridian (Greenwich) at 0 degrees longitude.</p>
<h4 id="ycoord">ycoord</h4>
<p>denotes the latitude coordinate (decimal degrees) for the centroid of the grid cell. Negative coordinates are located south of the Equator at 0 degrees latitude.</p>
<h2 id="the-static-table">The Static Table</h2>
<p>The static table contains a grid cell identifier (gid). This means that gid constitutes the unique identifier in the static file. The PRIO-GRID static table contains observations of all terrestrial grid cells (based on cShapes, thus excluding Antarctica, Greenland, and several smaller island states). In total, the table contains 64,818 observations.</p>
<h4 id="gid-1">gid</h4>
<p>is the grid cell identifier, a unique id code for each cell in the grid.</p>
<h4 id="landarea">landarea </h4>
<p>gives the total area covered by land in the grid cell in square kilometers as defined by the CShapes dataset. Hence, we exclude Antarctica, Greenland, and several smaller island states. Areas are calculated assuming that the earth in an oblate spheroid (WGS 84).</p>

<h2 id="the-temporal-table">The Temporal Table</h2>
<p>In addition to the grid identifier, the temporal data table also includes a year variable. This means that gid + year create a unique identifier in the time-series data. The PRIO-GRID v.2.0 temporal table contains yearly observations of all terrestrial grid cells (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) for all calendar years between 1946 and 2014. In total, the table contains 64,818 cells x 69 years = 4,472,442 observations (cell years) in total. However, all variables are not available for all years.</p>

<h4 id="gwno">gwno [<a href="http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes">Original data</a>]</h4>
<p>denotes the numerical country code for the country to which the cell is allocated, based on the Gleditsch &amp; Ward system membership list and cShapes geometries. Each cell is assigned to one and only one country in each yearly file. To determine country ownership, PRIO-GRID draws on the cShapes dataset v.0.4-2, last modified 22 Mar 2015. Grid cells that fall completely within the territory of an independent state are assigned the corresponding Gleditsch &amp; Ward country code (gwno). The country code reflects the status as of 31 December of each year, which means that in the case of territorial transfer (e.g., from East Pakistan to Bangladesh in 1971), a cell is given the country code that applies to the status at the end of the year, 31 December. Grid cells that cover the territory of two or more independent states (i.e., the cell intersects with multiple country polygons) are assigned to the country that covers the largest share of the cell's area. Note that while all terrestrial cells are included in the yearly file, country codes are assigned to cells only in those years that the host country is a member of the Gleditsch &amp; Ward international system.  Missing values imply non-independent territory.</p>

<p>indicates the gross cell product, measured in USD, based on the G-Econ dataset v4.0, last modified May 2011. The original G-Econ data represent the total economic activity at a 1x1 degree resolution, so when assigning this to PRIO-GRID we distribute the total value across the number of contained PRIO-GRID land cells. In border areas, the G-Econ 1x1 degree cells might overlap with PRIO-GRID cells allocated to a neighboring country. To minimize bias, PRIO-GRID only extracts G-Econ data for cells that have the same country code as the G-Econ cell represents. This variable is only available for five-year intervals since 1990.</p>
<p>Note: The user should be aware of the following special case. Differing definitions used by G-Econ and PRIO-GRID over the territorial border between Libya and Chad across all years resulted in no G-Econ cell being matched with PRIO-GRID's country definitions, leaving a small strip of cells in the border region with missing GCP data.</p>

<p>gives the severity of drought during the first month of the cell's rainy season, as defined by the <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('rainseas')">rainseas</a> variable. The severity value is the SPI1 value during the first month of the rainy season. The monthly SPI1 index measures deviation from long-term normal rainfall for that month. The values are standardized where deviation estimates less than 1 standard deviation indicate near normal rainfall.</p>
<p>We use SPI data from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Colombia University, as defined in Guttman (1999). The SPI values are calculated based on the <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/global_precip/html/wpage.cams_opi.html">CAMS_OPI</a> precipitation dataset.

For a year where the longest consecutive streak of months below -1.5 is three, the cell will be given a value of 3/12 = 0.25. When the longest streak starts in the previous year, it is only counted and included in the year in which the streak ended. Theoretically, the proportion can become higher than 1.</p>

The growing season is the growing season for the cell’s main crop, defined in the MIRCA2000 dataset v.1.1. For growing seasons that cross 1 January, we define the whole season to belong to the year in which the season ended. Thus, a year with two consecutive months below -1.5 during the growing season that started in September the previous year and ended in March in the current year, is given a value of 2/8 = 0.25. Each year only have defined one growing season.</p>

To compute <a href="" ng-click="book.scrollTo('barren_ih')">barren_ih</a> we aggregate using the following lansuse classes: &quot;Tundra&quot;, &quot;Desert&quot;, &quot;PdRI&quot;. In PRIO-GRID, this indicator is available for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010.</p>

<p>measures average nighttime light emission from the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4 (Average Visible, Stable Lights, &amp; Cloud Free Coverages). We use the data gathered from the newest satellites (F10 in 1992-93, F12 in 1994-1996, and so on). These data are not calibrated for time-series analysis, but are available from 1992-2013.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nlights_mean</strong> gives the mean night time lights within the grid cell.</li>
<li><strong>nlights_sd</strong> gives the standard deviation of original pixel values within each cell.</li>
<li><strong>nlights_min</strong> gives the minimum of original pixel values within each cell.</li>
<li><strong>nlights_max</strong> gives the maximum of original pixel values within each cell.</li>

<h4 id="nlights_calib_mean">nlights_calib_mean [<a href="http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html">Original data</a>]</h4>
<p>measures average nighttime light emission from the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4 (Average Visible, Stable Lights, &amp; Cloud Free Coverages), calibrated to account for intersatellite differences and interannual sensor decay using calibration values from Elvidge et.al. (2013). Thus, they might be more suitable for time-series analysis. Values are standardized to be between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest observed value in the time-series, and 0 is the lowest. The times-series are available from 1992-2012.</p>
