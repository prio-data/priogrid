\title{Make SPEIbase data PRIO-GRID compatible}
\usage{
speibaseN(interval, time_agg_fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{interval}{Integer. The month interval to calculate SPEI over. E.g., if the interval is
6, then monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are aggregated over the last 6 months,
then the SPEI (anomaly) is calculated. This is done for each month.}

\item{time_agg_fun}{Character. Either "mean" or "max". Original data is monthly, so if PRIO-GRID is lower
resolution, then we need to aggregate over time. Currently, mean and max functions are implemented.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object (from the \pkg{terra} package) with spatio-temporal
resolution as defined in PRIO-GRID.
}
\description{
The function takes monthly SPEIbase data and transforms it to the temporal
resolution defined by PRIO-GRID date intervals (which may be quarterly, yearly,
or other intervals), while also performing spatial aggregation to the PRIO-GRID resolution.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# SPEI-6 averaged over PRIO-GRID time-interval using the mean.
spei6_mean <- speibaseN(interval = 6, time_agg_fun = "mean")
}
