\title{Reads the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED)}
\usage{
read_ucdp_ged()
}
\value{
A \code{sf} object containing georeferenced conflict events with:
\itemize{
\item Geometry: Point locations of conflict events
\item date_start, date_end: Event timing information
\item date_interval: Lubridate interval for temporal operations
\item best, low, high: Fatality estimates (best estimate, low bound, high bound)
\item type_of_violence: Violence type classification (1, 2, or 3)
\item where_prec: Spatial precision code (1-7)
\item Coordinate reference system: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
}
}
\description{
Downloads and processes the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced
Event Dataset (UCDP GED), which provides detailed information on individual
events of organized violence worldwide. The function formats the data as a
spatial object compatible with PRIO-GRID temporal analysis.
}
\details{
UCDP GED is the most disaggregated dataset on organized violence, containing
information on individual events including their location, timing, actors,
and fatality estimates. This function:
\itemize{
\item Downloads UCDP GED version 25.1 if not already cached
\item Converts the data to an sf spatial object with WGS84 coordinates
\item Adds a date_interval utility column for temporal operations
\item Preserves all original UCDP GED variables including fatality estimates
}

The dataset includes three types of organized violence:
\itemize{
\item Type 1: State-based armed conflict
\item Type 2: Non-state conflict
\item Type 3: One-sided violence
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read UCDP GED data
ged_data <- read_ucdp_ged()

# Examine the structure
print(ged_data)

# Check available columns
names(ged_data)

# Filter to state-based conflict only
state_conflict <- ged_data[ged_data$type_of_violence == 1, ]

# Plot event locations
plot(sf::st_geometry(ged_data), pch = ".",
     main = "UCDP GED Event Locations")

# Filter to specific time period
library(lubridate)
events_2020 <- ged_data[year(ged_data$date_start) == 2020, ]
