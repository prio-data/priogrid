\title{Calculate distance to nearest land-contiguous border (bdist1)}
\usage{
bdist1(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes(), past_result = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{measurement_date}{A single \code{Date} object specifying the date for
boundary analysis. Must be within CShapes temporal coverage.}

\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data.
Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}

\item{past_result}{A list object from a previous \code{bdist1} calculation.
If boundaries haven't changed, the function returns this result directly,
avoiding recomputation. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{bdist1}: A \code{SpatRaster} with distances (km) from cell centroids
to nearest international borders, masked to state system coverage
\item \code{boundaries}: An \code{sf} object with country boundary line geometries
}
}
\description{
Computes the spherical distance (in kilometers) from each PRIO-GRID cell centroid
to the border of the nearest land-contiguous neighboring country using CShapes 2.0
boundary data. This implies that cells in e.g. Northern Denmark are measured to the
border to Germany even if the straight-line distance to Norway (across international waters)
is shorter. Cells belonging to island states with no contiguous neighboring country
(e.g., New Zealand) are coded as missing. Islands within states are still measured.
}
\details{
The function includes optimization logic that reuses previous calculations
if country boundaries haven't changed since the last computation, significantly
reducing processing time for temporal sequences.

Distance calculations use spherical geometry (S2) for accurate measurements
across the globe, particularly important for high-latitude regions.
