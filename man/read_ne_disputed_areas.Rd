\usage{
read_ne_disputed_areas()
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object
}
\description{
Downloads and imports the Natural Earth 1:10m scale Admin 0 Breakaway and
Disputed Areas dataset. This dataset depicts disputed and de facto political
boundaries, including areas with contested sovereignty or breakaway regions.
}
\details{
The dataset shows boundaries based on \strong{control (de facto)} rather than
\strong{international recognition (de jure)}. It is intended for visualization
and cartographic purposes. The dataset does not include temporal attributes,
so no specific time validity is provided.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Boundaries represent political disputes as mapped by Natural Earth;
they may not reflect all perspectives or claims
\item Dataset is not dated and does not provide historical change tracking
\item Intended for cartographic and analytical use, not for legal boundary
