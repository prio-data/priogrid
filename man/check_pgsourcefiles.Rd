\title{Test if MD5 checksums of local files are the same as a tested set of files}
\usage{
check_pgsourcefiles()
}
\description{
Here, we use \link{pgchecksum}, which we created when testing
PRIO-GRID, and test it against a similar method for your own
local files. This is to verify that you are using the same files
as we used to build PRIO-GRID.
