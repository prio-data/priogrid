\title{Generate Multi-Temporal Regionally Excluded Ethnic Groups Coverage}
\usage{
gen_geoepr_reg_excluded(
  excluded = c("DISCRIMINATED", "POWERLESS", "SELF-EXCLUSION")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{excluded}{A character vector specifying EPR status codes to classify as
"excluded". Valid EPR status codes include:
\itemize{
\item "DISCRIMINATED": Groups facing systematic discrimination
\item "POWERLESS": Groups lacking political influence
\item "SELF-EXCLUSION": Groups voluntarily excluding themselves from politics
\item "MONOPOLY": Groups holding exclusive power
\item "DOMINANT": Groups in dominant power positions
\item "SENIOR PARTNER": Senior coalition partners
\item "JUNIOR PARTNER": Junior coalition partners
\item "IRRELEVANT": Groups without political relevance
\item "STATE COLLAPSE": Groups during state collapse periods
}
Default is \code{c("DISCRIMINATED", "POWERLESS", "SELF-EXCLUSION")}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Creates a multi-layer raster indicating PRIO-GRID cells that contain settlement
areas of regionally based ethnic groups experiencing political exclusion. The
function combines GeoEPR spatial data with EPR Core political status information
to map areas where excluded ethnic groups are present over time.
}
\details{
The function focuses on "regionally based" ethnic groups, which have identifiable
settlement patterns that can be meaningfully mapped, as opposed to groups that
are dispersed throughout a country. Political exclusion is defined by EPR
status codes indicating systematic discrimination, powerlessness, or voluntary
self-exclusion from political processes.
