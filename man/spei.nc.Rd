\arguments{
\item{sca}{Integer. The time scale of the SPEI.}

\item{inPre}{Character vector. Path to the input precipitation netCDF file.}

\item{outFile}{Character vector. Path of the output netCDF file.}

\item{inEtp}{Character vector. Path to the input evapotranspiration netCDF file.}

\item{title}{Character vector. Title of the dataset.}

\item{comment}{Character vector. A comment.}

\item{version}{Character vector. Dataset version number.}

\item{inMask}{Character vector. Path to a netCDF mask file.}

\item{block}{Integer. Number of latitude blocks to be processed at the
same time. Must be an integer dividend of 360.}
}
\value{
Computes the SPEI time series and stores it in outFile following
the same data structure of inPre.
