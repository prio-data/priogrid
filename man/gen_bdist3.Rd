\title{Generate distance to a country's own borders (bdist3)}
\usage{
gen_bdist3(cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data with
temporal information. Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Creates a multi-layer raster containing the spherical distance (in kilometers) from each PRIO-GRID cell centroid
to the territorial outline of the country the cell belongs to using CShapes 2.0
boundary data for temporal time slices as defined in PRIOGRID.
}
\details{
The function automatically uses past results from previous time slices to
reduce computation time when country boundaries remain unchanged
between consecutive periods.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This function is computationally intensive and may take hours to complete
\item Progress indicators are printed during processing (time slice numbers)
\item The optimization using past results significantly reduces total computation time
\item Consider running in segments for very long time series to manage memory usage
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate full temporal border distance dataset
# Warning: This may take several hours to complete
temporal_bdist3 <- gen_bdist3()

print(temporal_bdist3)
