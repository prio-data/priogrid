\title{Rasterize UCDP GED Events for a Single Time Interval}
\usage{
rasterize_ged_crossection(ged, pg_interval, fatality_variable)
}
\arguments{
\item{ged}{An \code{sf} object containing UCDP GED data, typically from
\code{\link{read_ucdp_ged}} or processed through \code{\link{ucdp_ged}}.}

\item{pg_interval}{A \code{lubridate} interval object specifying the time
period for aggregation.}

\item{fatality_variable}{Character string specifying which fatality estimate
to aggregate. Options include "best", "low", "high", or "event_count" for
counting events rather than fatalities.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object with aggregated values for the specified
time interval. Layer name is set to the interval end date.
}
\description{
Internal function that aggregates UCDP GED conflict events to the PRIO-GRID
raster structure for a specified time interval. The function filters events
by temporal overlap and spatial precision before rasterization.
}
\details{
This function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Transforms event coordinates to match PRIO-GRID projection
\item Filters events to those overlapping the specified time interval
\item Removes events with spatial precision code >= 6 (sub-national precision required)
\item Filters by specified violence types
\item Rasterizes events by summing the specified fatality variable or counting events
}

Spatial precision filtering removes events coded at national level or higher
uncertainty, which may lead to undercounting in some regions.
