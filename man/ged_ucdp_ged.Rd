\title{Generate UCDP GED Battle-Related Deaths Variable}
\usage{
ged_ucdp_ged()
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object with multiple layers, one for each time
interval defined in \code{\link{pg_date_intervals}}. Each layer contains:
\itemize{
\item Cell values: Sum of best fatality estimates for events in that cell and period
\item Layer names: Character representation of interval end dates
\item NA values: Grid cells with no recorded events or outside state system
}
}
\description{
Creates a multi-layer raster containing aggregated fatality counts from the
UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset for all PRIO-GRID temporal slices. This is
the standard generator function for including UCDP GED data in PRIO-GRID.
}
\details{
This function generates the standard UCDP GED variable for PRIO-GRID using:
\itemize{
\item The "best" fatality estimate from UCDP GED
\item All three types of organized violence (state-based, non-state, one-sided)
\item Temporal distribution of fatalities across PRIO-GRID intervals
\item Spatial filtering to exclude events without sub-national precision
}

Events are filtered to include only those with spatial precision codes 1-5,
which represent locations identified at sub-national level or better. Events
coded at national level (where_prec = 6) or with higher uncertainty (where_prec = 7)
are excluded. This filtering approach may result in undercounting, particularly
in regions where precise event locations are difficult to determine.

The function uses the "best" fatality estimate, which represents UCDP's
assessment of the most likely number of fatalities based on available sources.
Alternative estimates (low, high) can be accessed through \code{\link{ucdp_ged}}.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Processing time depends on the size of the UCDP GED dataset
\item The exclusion of imprecisely located events is a known limitation
\item For custom configurations, use \code{\link{ucdp_ged}} directly
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate standard UCDP GED variable
ged_fatalities <- ged_ucdp_ged()

# Examine the result
print(ged_fatalities)

# Check number of time periods
terra::nlyr(ged_fatalities)

# Plot first time period
terra::plot(ged_fatalities[[1]],
            main = paste("Fatalities:", names(ged_fatalities)[1]))

# Calculate annual totals
annual_total <- terra::app(ged_fatalities, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
terra::plot(annual_total, main = "Total Fatalities Across All Periods",
            col = hcl.colors(100, "YlOrRd", rev = TRUE))

# Identify hotspots
hotspots <- annual_total > 100
terra::plot(hotspots, main = "Conflict Hotspots (>100 fatalities)")
}
