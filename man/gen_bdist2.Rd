\title{Generate multi-temporal distance to international borders data (bdist2)}
\usage{
gen_bdist2(cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data with
temporal information. Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Creates a multi-layer raster containing distances to nearest international
borders for all PRIO-GRID temporal slices. The function generates time series
data showing how proximity to international boundaries changes over time due
to territorial changes, state formation, and dissolution events.
}
\details{
The function automatically uses past results from previous time slices to
dramatically reduce computation time when country boundaries remain unchanged
between consecutive periods. This makes temporal sequence generation much
more efficient than calculating each period independently.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This function is computationally intensive and may take hours to complete
\item Progress indicators are printed during processing (time slice numbers)
\item The optimization using past results significantly reduces total computation time
\item Consider running in segments for very long time series to manage memory usage
