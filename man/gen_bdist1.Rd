\title{Generate distance to nearest land-contiguous border over time (bdist1)}
\usage{
gen_bdist1(cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data with
temporal information. Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Creates a multi-layer raster containing distances
to the border of the nearest land-contiguous neighboring country using CShapes 2.0
boundary data for temporal time slices as defined in PRIOGRID.
This implies that cells in e.g. Northern Denmark are measured to the
border to Germany even if the straight-line distance to Norway (across international waters)
is shorter. Cells belonging to island states with no contiguous neighboring country
(e.g., New Zealand) are coded as missing. Islands within states are still measured.
}
\details{
The function automatically uses past results from previous time slices to
reduce computation time when country boundaries remain unchanged
between consecutive periods.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This function is computationally intensive and may take hours to complete
\item Progress indicators are printed during processing (time slice numbers)
\item The optimization using past results significantly reduces total computation time
\item Consider running in segments for very long time series to manage memory usage
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate full temporal border distance dataset
# Warning: This may take several hours to complete
temporal_bdist1 <- gen_bdist1()

print(temporal_bdist1)
