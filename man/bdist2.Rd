\title{Calculate distance to nearest international border (bdist2)}
\usage{
bdist2(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes(), past_result = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{measurement_date}{A single \code{Date} object specifying the date for
boundary analysis. Must be within CShapes temporal coverage.}

\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data.
Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}

\item{past_result}{A list object from a previous \code{bdist2} calculation.
If boundaries haven't changed, the function returns this result directly,
avoiding recomputation. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{bdist2}: A \code{SpatRaster} with distances (km) from cell centroids
to nearest international borders, masked to state system coverage
\item \code{boundaries}: An \code{sf} object with country boundary line geometries
\item \code{shared_borders}: An \code{sf} object with shared border segments
between neighboring countries
}
}
\description{
Computes the spherical distance (in kilometers) from each PRIO-GRID cell
centroid to the nearest international border using CShapes 2.0 boundary data.
The function calculates distances to shared borders between countries,
regardless of whether countries are separated by international waters.
}
\details{
The function includes optimization logic that reuses previous calculations
if country boundaries haven't changed since the last computation, significantly
reducing processing time for temporal sequences.

Distance calculations use spherical geometry (S2) for accurate measurements
across the globe, particularly important for high-latitude regions.
