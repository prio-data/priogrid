\title{Reads the Li Nighttime data}
\usage{
read_linight(overwrite_files = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{overwrite_files}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, previously fixed rasters are
recalculated and overwritten. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
an object of class sf
}
\description{
Downloads, preprocesses, and harmonizes the Li et al. global nighttime
light dataset (v8). This dataset provides global, annual composites
of nighttime light intensity, harmonized across multiple satellite
sensors to produce a consistent multi-decadal time series.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Downloads the zipped Li Nighttime Lights raster files from the
PRIO-GRID data repository
\item Extracts TIF files, caching results to avoid repeated unzipping
\item Identifies rasters with extent mismatches (common in the dataset)
\item Resamples problematic rasters to a standardized global template
(\code{EPSG:4326}, extent -180/180, -90/90) using nearest neighbor
resampling
\item Stores corrected rasters with a \code{"fixed_"} prefix for reuse
\item Combines corrected rasters into a multi-layer \code{SpatRaster}
\item Assigns layer names as dates, aligned to PRIO-GRID temporal
conventions (January 1 of each year by default)
