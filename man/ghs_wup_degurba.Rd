\title{Apply urban classification to GHS-WUP-DEGURBA data}
\usage{
ghs_wup_degurba(urban_definition)
}
\arguments{
\item{urban_definition}{Numeric vector of DEGURBA codes to classify as urban.
Valid codes are: 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 30. See Details for code meanings.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object with values ranging from 0 to 1, representing
the proportion of urban area within each PRIO-GRID cell according to the
specified urban definition.
}
\description{
Reclassifies the GHS-WUP-DEGURBA data into binary urban/non-urban categories
based on a user-defined set of DEGURBA classification codes. The function
aggregates the resulting binary classification to PRIO-GRID resolution,
providing the proportion of urban area within each PRIO-GRID cell.
}
\details{
The DEGURBA classification codes represent:
\itemize{
\item 30: Urban centres (cities)
\item 23: Dense urban cluster
\item 22: Semi-dense urban cluster
\item 21: Suburban or peri-urban
\item 13: Rural cluster
\item 12: Low density rural
\item 11: Very low density rural
\item 10: Water bodies or uninhabited areas
}

The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Reads the high-resolution GHS-WUP-DEGURBA data
\item Reclassifies cells to 1 (urban) if they match \code{urban_definition}, 0 otherwise
\item Aggregates to PRIO-GRID resolution using mean (proportion of urban area)
\item Applies nearest-neighbor resampling for exact PRIO-GRID alignment
}

A slight nearest neighbor resampling was applied to get the exact PRIO-GRID extent.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item This operation can be computationally intensive for large rasters
\item Temporary files are created during processing
\item The aggregation uses mean to calculate urban proportion per cell
\item Different urban definitions produce different urbanization estimates
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use only urban centres as urban definition
urban_strict <- ghs_wup_degurba(urban_definition = 30)

# Use broader urban definition (all urban and suburban areas)
urban_broad <- ghs_wup_degurba(urban_definition = c(21, 22, 23, 30))

# Plot comparison
terra::plot(urban_strict[["2020-12-31"]],
            main = "Strict Urban Definition (Centres Only)")
terra::plot(urban_broad[["2020-12-31"]],
            main = "Broad Urban Definition")

# Custom definition: exclude suburban areas
urban_custom <- ghs_wup_degurba(urban_definition = c(22, 23, 30))
}
