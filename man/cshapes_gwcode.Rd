\title{Assign Gleditsch-Ward Country Codes to PRIO-GRID Cells}
\usage{
cshapes_gwcode(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{measurement_date}{A single \code{Date} object specifying the date for
country assignment. Must be within the temporal range of the CShapes dataset.}

\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data with
Gleditsch-Ward country codes. Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()} if not provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Determines the dominant country in each PRIO-GRID cell using CShapes 2.0
boundary data and assigns the corresponding Gleditsch-Ward country code.
For cells containing multiple countries, the country with the largest area
coverage is assigned, with ties broken by selecting the lowest country code.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Small countries or territories may not appear if they don't dominate any grid cells
\item The function includes an assertion check to verify all countries are represented
\item Future versions may include provisions for minority country representation
