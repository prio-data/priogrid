\title{Generate PRIO-GRID Compatible CRU Near Surface Temperature Data}
\usage{
gen_cru_tmp()
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object (from the \pkg{terra} package) with spatio-temporal
resolution as defined in PRIO-GRID.
}
\description{
This function processes CRU TS (Climate Research Unit Time Series) v4.09
near surface temperature data by aggregating it both temporally and spatially
to match PRIO-GRID specifications. The function takes monthly CRU temperature
data and transforms it to the temporal resolution defined by PRIO-GRID date
intervals (which may be quarterly, yearly, or other intervals), while also
performing spatial aggregation to the PRIO-GRID resolution.
}
\details{
This takes the CRU TS dataset and aggregates it in time and space to
PRIO-GRID specifications.
