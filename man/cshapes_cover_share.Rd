\title{Calculate Grid Cell Coverage by International State System Boundaries (cShapes 2.0)}
\usage{
cshapes_cover_share(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{measurement_date}{A single \code{Date} object specifying the date for
which to calculate boundary coverage. Must be within the temporal range
of the CShapes dataset (1886 onwards).}

\item{cshp}{An \code{sf} object containing CShapes 2.0 boundary data with
properly formatted date intervals. Defaults to \code{\link{read_cshapes}()}
if not provided.}
}
\description{
Computes the proportion of each PRIO-GRID cell that intersects with country
boundaries from the CShapes 2.0 dataset at a specified date. The function
performs spatial overlay analysis to determine how much of each grid cell
falls within internationally recognized state boundaries.
}
\details{
This function uses CShapes 2.0 historical boundary data to calculate the
proportion of each PRIO-GRID cell covered by countries that were part of
the international state system at the measurement date. The function:
\itemize{
\item Filters CShapes data to boundaries valid at the measurement date
\item Performs exact area-weighted extraction using the exactextractr package
\item Returns proportional coverage values (0-1) for each grid cell
\item Masks out non-land areas from the final result
}

The coverage values represent the fraction of each PRIO-GRID cell area that
falls within internationally recognized state boundaries.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate state system coverage for 2010
coverage_2010 <- cshapes_cover_share(as.Date("2010-01-01"))

# View the result
print(coverage_2010)

# Plot the coverage
terra::plot(coverage_2010,
            main = "cShapes coverage 2010",
            col = terrain.colors(100))

# Calculate coverage for different time periods
coverage_1950 <- cshapes_cover_share(as.Date("1950-01-01"))
coverage_2000 <- cshapes_cover_share(as.Date("2000-01-01"))

# Compare coverage over time
coverage_change <- coverage_2000 - coverage_1950
terra::plot(coverage_change,
            main = "Change in cShapes coverage 1950-2000")
