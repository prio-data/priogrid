\title{Calculate Grid Cell Coverage by International State System Boundaries (cShapes 2.0)}
\usage{
cshapes_cover_share(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes())

cshapes_cover_share(measurement_date, cshp = read_cshapes())
}
\arguments{
\item{measurement_date}{A single date as Date object}

\item{cshp}{The CShapes dataset, for instance as given by \code{\link[=read_cshapes]{read_cshapes()}}}
}
\description{
Computes the proportion of each PRIO-GRID cell that intersects with country
boundaries from the CShapes 2.0 dataset at a specified date. The function
performs spatial overlay analysis to determine how much of each grid cell
falls within internationally recognized state boundaries.
}
\details{
This function uses CShapes 2.0 historical boundary data to calculate the
proportion of each PRIO-GRID cell covered by countries that were part of
the international state system at the measurement date. The function:
\itemize{
\item Filters CShapes data to boundaries valid at the measurement date
\item Performs exact area-weighted extraction using the exactextractr package
\item Returns proportional coverage values (0-1) for each grid cell
\item Masks out non-land areas from the final result
}

The coverage values represent the fraction of each PRIO-GRID cell area that
falls within internationally recognized state boundaries.
