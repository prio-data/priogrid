\title{Generate GHSL GHS Population Grid}
\usage{
gen_ghsl_population_grid()
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object
}
\description{
Aggregates the high-resolution GHSL (Global Human Settlement Layer) GHS
Population Grid data to PRIO-GRID resolution for all available 5-year
intervals (1975–2030). This provides population counts per PRIO-GRID cell.
}
\details{
This operation can be computationally intensive and may take time depending
on system performance and the size of the underlying rasters.

A slight nearest neighbor resampling was applied to get the exact PRIO-GRID extent.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Aggregation uses sum to preserve total population counts
\item Nearest-neighbor resampling is applied for spatial alignment
\item Large rasters may require significant memory and processing time
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate PRIO-GRID level GHSL population rasters
ghsl_pg <- gen_ghsl_population_grid()

# Inspect structure
print(ghsl_pg)

# Plot population for 2020
terra::plot(ghsl_pg[["2020-12-31"]],
            main = "PRIO-GRID Population Distribution 2020")

# Compute total population per PRIO-GRID cell change over time
pop_1990 <- ghsl_pg[["1990-12-31"]]
pop_2020 <- ghsl_pg[["2020-12-31"]]
change <- pop_2020 - pop_1990
terra::plot(change, main = "Population Change 1990–2020")
