  abstract = {ESA WorldCover 10 m 2021~v200 The European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover 10 m 2021~product provides a global land cover map for 2021~at 10 m resolution based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The WorldCover product comes with 11 land cover classes,~aligned with UN-FAO's Land Cover Classification System, and has been generated in the framework of the ESA WorldCover project. The ESA WorldCover 10m 2021 v200 product updates the existing ESA WorldCover 10m 2020~v100 product to 2021 but~is produced using an improved algorithm version (v200) compared to the 2020 map. Consequently, since the WorldCover maps for 2020 and 2021 were generated with different algorithm versions (v100 and v200, respectively), changes between the maps should be treated with caution, as they include both real changes in land cover and changes due to the algorithms used. The WorldCover 2021 v200 product is developed by a consortium lead by VITO Remote Sensing~together with~partners Brockmann Consult, Gamma Remote Sensing AG, IIASA and Wageningen University Click here to view the maps More information about the land cover maps Product User Manual \& Product Validation Report},
