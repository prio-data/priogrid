  abstract = {Widely available data on the number of people living outside of their country of birth do not adequately capture contemporary intensities and patterns of global migration flows. We present data on bilateral flows between 196 countries from 1990 through 2010 that provide a comprehensive view of international migration flows. Our data suggest a stable intensity of global 5-year migration flows at {\textasciitilde}0.6\% of world population since 1995. In addition, the results aid the interpretation of trends and patterns of migration flows to and from individual countries by placing them in a regional or global context. We estimate the largest movements to occur between South and West Asia, from Latin to North America, and within Africa.}

  abstract = {Human activity is a major driver of change and has contributed to many of the challenges we face today. Detailed information about human population distribution is fundamental and use of freely available, high-resolution, gridded datasets on global population as a source of such information is increasing. However, there is little research to guide users in dataset choice. This study evaluates five of the most commonly used global gridded population datasets against a high-resolution Swedish population dataset on a pixel level. We show that datasets which employ more complex modeling techniques exhibit lower errors overall but no one dataset performs best under all situations. Furthermore, differences exist in how unpopulated areas are identified and changes in algorithms over time affect accuracy. Our results provide guidance in navigating the differences between the most commonly used gridded population datasets and will help researchers and policy makers identify the most suitable datasets under varying conditions.},

To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2---to end preventable child deaths by 2030---we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000--2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32\% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58\% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.},

  abstract = {The Global Human Settlement Population Grid (GHS-POP) the latest released global gridded population dataset based on remotely sensed data and developed by the EU Joint Research Centre, depicts the distribution and density of the total population as the number of people per grid cell. This study aims to assess the GHS-POP data accuracy based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the correlation coefficient. The study was conducted for Poland and Portugal, countries characterized by different population distribution as well as two spatial resolutions of 250 m and 1 km on the GHS-POP. The main findings show that as the size of administrative zones decreases (from NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) to LAU (local administrative unit)) and the size of the GHS-POP increases, the difference between the population counts reported by the European Statistical Office and estimated by the GHS-POP algorithm becomes larger. At the national level, MAPE ranges from 1.8\% to 4.5\% for the 250 m and 1 km resolutions of GHS-POP data in Portugal and 1.5\% to 1.6\%, respectively in Poland. At the local level, however, the error rates range from 4.5\% to 5.8\% in Poland, for 250 m and 1 km, and 5.7\% to 11.6\% in Portugal, respectively. Moreover, the results show that for densely populated regions the GHS-POP underestimates the population number, while for thinly populated regions it overestimates. The conclusions of this study are expected to serve as a quality reference for potential users and producers of population density datasets.},

  abstract = {In this article, we introduce the Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations (Geo-PKO) dataset, which presents new data on subnational peacekeeping deployment for all UN missions to Africa, 1994--2014. The Geo-PKO dataset is the most comprehensive dataset of its kind and enables scholars to address new questions about peacekeeping operations and their effects by exploring variations in peacekeeping at the subnational level. The dataset offers information on several key features of peacekeeping deployment at the local level, such as data on the size of deployments and how these vary over time, as well as information on the location of mission headquarters, the type of peacekeepers deployed, and which troop-contributing countries deploy to each location. This article describes the data collection process and illustrates some of the many utilities of this dataset for the scholarly community. For example, we show that peacekeeping troops are able to reduce battle-related violence in areas with high road density, suggesting that peacekeepers' ability to project their power is stronger when they can increase their reach and more easily patrol larger territories. Hence, our data can fruitfully be combined with information such as socio-economic, geographical or demographic characteristics, to further explore how peacekeeping operations can contribute to peace and security in the areas where they operate. By providing fine-grained data on the location of peacekeepers across time and space, the Geo-PKO dataset should help facilitate important inquires that can push the research agenda on peacekeeping forward.},

  abstract = {This article examines trends in organized violence based on new data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). In 2023, fatalities from organized violence decreased for the first time since the rapid increase observed in 2020, dropping from 310,000 in 2022 to 154,000 in 2023. Despite this decline, these figures represent some of the highest fatality rates recorded since the Rwandan genocide in 1994, surpassed only by those of 2022 and 2021. The decrease was primarily attributed to the end of the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, which accounted for about 60\% of battle-related deaths in both 2022 and 2021. Despite this positive development, the number of active state-based armed conflicts increased by three in 2023, reaching the highest level ever recorded by the UCDP, totaling 59. Non-state conflicts and one-sided violence decreased in 2023 when compared to 2022, evident in both the reduction of the active conflicts/actors and the decrease in fatalities attributed to these forms of violence. However, despite this overall decrease, fatalities resulting from non-state conflicts remained at historically high levels in 2023. Analysis of non-state conflict data spanning the past decade reveals that it comprises the ten most violent years on record. Organized crime groups have predominantly fueled this escalation. Unlike rebel groups, organized crime groups typically lack political goals and are primarily motivated by economic gain. Conflicts between these groups tend to intensify around drug smuggling routes and in urban areas, driven by shifts in alliances and leadership dynamics among the actors.},

  abstract = {A consistently processed annual global nighttime lights time series (2012--2019) was produced using monthly cloud-free radiance averages made from low light imaging day/night band (DNB) data collected by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The processing steps are modified from the original methods developed to produce annual nighttime lights products from nightly data. Only two years of VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL) were produced with the V.1 methods: 2015 and 2016. Here we report on methods used to produce a V.2 VNL time series from the monthly averages with filtering to remove extraneous features such as biomass burning, aurora, and background. In this case, outlier removal is achieved with a twelve-month median, which discards high and low radiance outliers, thus isolating the background to a narrow range of radiances under 1 nW/cm2/sr. Background areas with no detectable lighting are further isolated using a statistical measure of texture, 3 {\texttimes} 3 data range (DR). The DR threshold for zeroing out background rises as the number of cloud-free observations falls. The V.2 method extends the temporal leverage in the noise filtering by developing the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum DR and a multiyear percent cloud-free grid. Additional noise filtering is achieved by zeroing out grid cells that have low average radiances ({$<$}0.6 nW/cm2/sr) and detection in only one or two years out of eight. The spatial extent and average radiance levels are compared for the V.1 and V.2 2015 VNL. For the vast majority of grid cells, the average radiances are nearly the same in the two products. However, the V.2 product has more areas of dim lighting detected. The key advantages of the V.2 time series include consistent processing and threshold levels across all years, thus optimizing the set for change detection analyses.},

These rates tend to reflect the urban-rural divide, typically with urban areas experiencing higher accessibility than rural ones. Especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region experiencing high disease burden amid fast urbanisation and population growth. However, such assessment has been hindered by a lack of updated and comparable geospatial data on urbanisation and health facilities. In this study, we apply the UN-endorsed Degree of Urbanisation (DoU or DEGURBA) method to investigate how geographic access to healthcare facilities varies across the urban-rural continuum in SSA as a whole and in each country, for circa 2020. Results show that geographic access is overall highest in cities and peri-urban areas, where more than 95\% of inhabitants live within 30~min from the nearest HCF, with this share decreasing to 80--90\% in towns. This share is lowest in villages and dispersed rural areas (65\%), with about 10--15\% of population more than 3~h away from any health post. Challenges in geographic access seem mostly determined by high travel impedance, since overall spatial densities of HCF are comparable to European levels.},

Despite progress, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level.

The recently released Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDIv1) dataset by NASA has been utilized. The GRDIv1 index contains six pivotal components: Child Dependency Ratio, Subnational Development Index, Infant Mortality Rate, Built-Up to Non-Built-Up Ratios, VIIRS nighttime lights, and VIIRS Nighttime Lights (VNL) Slope Component. All the components capture various aspects of regional poverty differences. The results show the eastern regions have significantly higher levels of deprivation than the western regions. This disparity is attributed to conflicts, unemployment, and illiteracy in the East, while the West benefits from higher development. The analysis of the ratio of Built-Up Areas to Non-Built-Up Areas reveals a complex distribution of urbanization and industrialization, with the western Marmara region emerging as a center of development and industrial activity. Moreover, the analysis of Nocturnal Illumination Patterns, based on VIIRS nighttime light data, further confirms the higher levels of development in the west and the deprivation in the east. This study objectively proves that the Eastern region of Turkiye contains areas with much higher deprivation than does central and western regions.},

The empirical results, which are robust across a wide range of specifications as well as to using alternative identification strategies, suggest a positive impact of World Bank aid on citizens' expressed willingness to abide by key formal institutions. This applies for overall World Bank aid, but as may be expected, the estimated effects are more pronounced when restricting our attention to projects focusing on institution building. Notably, the observed effects concern finalized projects, not projects still under implementation, highlighting that institutional change is a slow process.},

  abstract = {Aim This paper presents a tool for long-term global change studies; it is an update of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) with estimates of some of the underlying demographic and agricultural driving factors. Methods Historical population, cropland and pasture statistics are combined with satellite information and specific allocation algorithms (which change over time) to create spatially explicit maps, which are fully consistent on a 5{$\prime$} longitude/latitude grid resolution, and cover the period 10,000 bc to ad 2000. Results Cropland occupied roughly less than 1\% of the global ice-free land area for a long time until ad 1000, similar to the area used for pasture. In the centuries that followed, the share of global cropland increased to 2\% in ad 1700 (c. 3 million km2) and 11\% in ad 2000 (15 million km2), while the share of pasture area grew from 2\% in ad 1700 to 24\% in ad 2000 (34 million km2) These profound land-use changes have had, and will continue to have, quite considerable consequences for global biogeochemical cycles, and subsequently global climate change. Main conclusions Some researchers suggest that humans have shifted from living in the Holocene (emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (humans capable of changing the Earth's atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and magnitude of some historical land-use changes (e.g. as result of the depopulation of Europe due to the Black Death in the 14th century and the aftermath of the colonization of the Americas in the 16th century) we believe that this point might have occurred earlier in time. While there are still many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change) in the global biogeochemical cycle, we hope that this database can help global (climate) change modellers to close parts of this gap.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has experienced numerous hydrometeorological disasters along with it. The pandemic has made disaster relief work more challenging for humanitarian organizations and governments. This study aims to provide an overview of the topics/issues of concern in the countries while responding to hydrometeorological extreme events (e.g., floods and cyclones) during the pandemic. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a computational topic modeling technique, is employed to reduce the numerous (i.e., 1771) humanitarian reports/news to key terms and meaningful topics for 24 countries. Several insights are derived from the LDA results. It is identified that countries have suffered multiple crises (such as locust attacks, epidemics and conflicts) during the pandemic. Maintaining social distancing while disaster evacuation and circumventing the lockdown for relief work have been difficult. Children are an important topic for most countries; however, other vulnerable groups such as women and the disabled also need to be focused upon. Hygiene is not a highly weighted topic, which is of concern during a pandemic that mandates good sanitation to control it effectively. However, health is of great importance for almost all countries. The novelty of the paper lies in its interdisciplinary approach (usage of a computational technique in disaster management studies) and the timely examination of disaster management experiences during the ongoing pandemic. The insights presented in the study may be helpful for researchers and policy-makers to initiate further bottom-up work to address the challenges in responding to hydrometeorological disasters during a pandemic.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the largest global consumer of water. Irrigated areas constitute 40\&thinsp;\% of the total area used for agricultural production (FAO, 2014a) Information on their spatial distribution is highly relevant for regional water management and food security. Spatial information on irrigation is highly important for policy and decision makers, who are facing the transition towards more efficient sustainable agriculture. However, the mapping of irrigated areas still represents a challenge for land use classifications, and existing global data sets differ strongly in their results. The following study tests an existing irrigation map based on statistics and extends the irrigated area using ancillary data. The approach processes and analyzes multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) SPOT-VGT data and agricultural suitability data -- both at a spatial resolution of 30\&thinsp;arcsec -- incrementally in a multiple decision tree. It covers the period from 1999 to 2012. The results globally show a 18\&thinsp;\% larger irrigated area than existing approaches based on statistical data. The largest differences compared to the official national statistics are found in Asia and particularly in China and India. The additional areas are mainly identified within already known irrigated regions where irrigation is more dense than previously estimated. The validation with global and regional products shows the large divergence of existing data sets with respect to size and distribution of irrigated areas caused by spatial resolution, the considered time period and the input data and assumption made.},

  abstract = {In the last few decades the magnitude and impacts of planetary urban transformations have become increasingly evident to scientists and policymakers. The ability to understand these processes remained limited in terms of territorial scope and comparative capacity for a long time: data availability and harmonization were among the main constraints. Contemporary technological assets, such as remote sensing and machine learning, allow for analyzing global changes in the settlement process with unprecedented detail. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project set out to produce detailed datasets to analyze and monitor the spatial footprint of human settlements and their population, which are key indicators for the global policy commitments of the 2030 Development Agenda. In the GHSL, Earth Observation plays a key role in the detection of built-up areas from the Landsat imagery upon which population distribution is modelled. The combination of remote sensing imagery and population modelling allows for generating globally consistent and detailed information about the spatial distribution of built-up areas and population. The GHSL data facilitate a multi-temporal analysis of human settlements with global coverage. The results presented in this article focus on the patterns of development of built-up areas, population and settlements. The article reports about the present status of global urbanization (2015) and its evolution since 1990 by applying to the GHSL the Degree of Urbanisation definition of the European Commission Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG-Regio) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT). The analysis portrays urbanization dynamics at a regional level and per country income classes to show disparities and inequalities. This study analyzes how the 6.1 billion urban dwellers are distributed worldwide. Results show the degree of global urbanization (which reached 85\% in 2015), the more than 100 countries in which urbanization has increased between 1990 and 2015, and the tens of countries in which urbanization is today above the global average and where urbanization grows the fastest. The paper sheds light on the key role of urban areas for development, on the patterns of urban development across the regions of the world and on the role of a new generation of data to advance urbanization theory and reporting.},

  abstract = {Food insecurity is a major issue in many parts of the world, driven by conflict, economic instability, environmental challenges, and poor governance processes. Understanding the impact of future rainfall extremes on areas already experiencing food insecurity is crucial. This study investigates how food insecurity hotspots (FIH), food crisis frequency, and duration will change in the near future (2021--2050) and far future (2071--2100) under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). The study utilizes precipitation data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and FIH data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). To calculate future exposure and vulnerability to FIH, as well as food crisis frequency and duration, weighted sum models were used. The results indicate that arid and semi-arid areas in northeastern Kenya, most of Somalia, zones in southeastern Ethiopia, most of Djibouti, and central and northern Sudan are highly vulnerable to future extreme rainfall events, an increase in FIH cases, and longer food crisis frequency and duration in the near future (2021--2050) and far future (2071--2100) under all scenarios. On the other hand, most districts in Uganda, southern and southwestern South Sudan, counties in western Kenya, and the majority of zones in western Ethiopia are projected to have very few FIH cases, low food crisis frequency, and duration in both the near and far future under all scenarios. These findings are crucial for early warning systems, humanitarian responses, and food security interventions. We recommend harnessing projected increases in rainfall for water harvesting in Kenya, as well as promoting cash and food crop production in central and western Ethiopia, central and northern Uganda, and most of South Sudan.},

  abstract = {The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project fosters an enhanced, public understanding of the human presence on Earth. A decade after its inception in the Digital Earth 2020 vision, GHSL is an established project of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and an integral part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The 2023 GHSL edition, a result of rigorous research on Earth Observation data and population censuses, contributes significantly to understanding worldwide human settlements. It introduces new elements like 10-m-resolution, sub-pixel estimation of built-up surfaces, global building height and volume estimates, and a classification of residential and non-residential areas, improving population density grids. This paper evaluates the key components of the GHSL, including the Symbolic Machine Learning approach, using novel reference data. These data enable a comparative assessment of GHSL model predictions on the evolution of built-up surface, building heights, and resident population. Empirical evidence suggests that GHSL estimates are the most accurate in the public domain today, e.g. achieving an IoU of 0.98 for the water class, 0.92 for the built-up class, and 0.8 for the non-residential class at 10 m resolution. At 100 m resolution, we find that the MAE of built-up surface estimates corresponds to 6\% of the grid cell area, the MAE for the building height estimates is 2.27 m, and we find a total allocation accuracy of 83\% for resident population. This paper consolidates the theoretical foundation of the GHSL and highlights its innovative features for transparent Artificial Intelligence, facilitating international decision-making processes.},

The data is made by spatial-temporal interpolation of five observed collections of multiple-sensor, multiple-platform satellite imageries. Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM sensor) supports the 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2014 epochs. Sentinel2 (S2) composite (GHS-composite-S2 R2020A) supports the 2018 epoch. The built-up surface fraction (BUFRAC) is estimated at 10m of spatial resolution from the S2 image data, using as learning set a composite of data from GHS-BUILT-S2 R2020A, Facebook, Microsoft, and Open Street Map (OSM) building delineation. The BUFRAC inference is made from the combination of quantized image features (reflectance, derivative of morphological profile DMP) through associative rule learning applied to spatial data analytics, which was introduced as symbolic machine learning (SML). The non-residential (NRES) domain is predicted from S2 image data by observation of radiometric, textural, and morphological features in an object-oriented image processing framework. The multi-temporal dimension is provided by testing by the SML the association between the combination of the quantized radiometric information collected by the Landsat imagery in the past epochs, and the ``built-up'' (BU) and ``non-built-up'' (NBU) class abstraction on image segments extracted from S2 images. The spatial-temporal interpolation is solved by rank-optimal spatial allocation using explanatory variables related to the landscape (slope, elevation, distance to water, and distance to vegetation) and related to the observed dynamic of BU surfaces in the past epochs.},

The test involved the mapping of 24.3 million km2 of the Earth surface spread in four continents, corresponding to an estimated population of 1.3 billion people in 2010. The resolution of the input image data ranges from 0.5 to 10 meters, collected by a heterogeneous set of platforms including satellite SPOT (2 and 5), CBERS 2B, RapidEye (2 and 4), WorldView (1 and 2), GeoEye 1, QuickBird 2, Ikonos 2, and airborne sensors. Several imaging modes were tested including panchromatic, multispectral and pan-sharpened images. A new fully automatic image information extraction, generalization and mosaic workflow is presented that is based on multiscale textural and morphological image features extraction. New image feature compression and optimization are introduced, together with new learning and classification techniques allowing for the processing of HR/VHR image data using low-resolution thematic layers as reference. A new systematic approach for quality control and validation allowing global spatial and thematic consistency checking is proposed and applied. The quality of the results are discussed by sensor, band, resolution, and eco-regions. Critical points, lessons learned and next steps are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Abstract              Conflict event datasets are used widely in academic, policymaking, and public spheres. Accounting for political violence across the world requires detailing conflict types, agents, characteristics, and source information. The public and policymaking communities may underestimate the impact of data collection decisions across global, real-time conflict event datasets. Here, we consider four widely used public datasets with global coverage and demonstrate how they differ by definitions of conflict, and which aspects of the information-sourcing processes they prioritize. First, we identify considerable disparities between automated conflict coding projects and researcher-led projects, largely resulting from few inclusion barriers and no data oversight. Second, we compare researcher-led datasets in greater detail. At the crux of their differences is whether a dataset prioritizes and mandates internal reliability by imposing initial conflict definitions on present events, or whether a dataset's agenda is to capture an externally valid and comprehensive assessment of present violence patterns. Prioritizing reliability privileges specific forms of violence, despite the possibility that other forms actually occur; and leads to reliance on international and English-language information sources. Privileging validity requires a wide definition of political violence forms, and requires diverse, multi-lingual, and local sources. These conceptual, coding, and sourcing variations have significant implications for the use of these data in academic analysis and for practitioner responses to crisis and instability. These foundational differences mean that answers to ``which country is most violent?''; ``where are civilians most at risk?''; and ``is the frequency of conflict increasing or decreasing?'' vary according to datasets all purporting to capture the same phenomena of political violence.},

These datasets demonstrate an enormous improvement over the conventional use of choropleth maps to represent population distribution and are vital for analysis and planning purposes including humanitarian response, disease mapping, risk analysis, and evacuation modeling. Dasymetric mapping techniques have been employed to address spatial mismatch, but also to develop finer resolution population distributions in areas of the world where subnational census data are coarse or non-existent. One such implementation is the LandScan Global model which provides a 30 arc-second global population distribution based on ancillary datasets such as land cover, slope, proximity to roads, and settlement locations. This work will review the current state of the LandScan model, future innovations aimed at increasing spatial and demographic resolution, and situate LandScan within the landscape of other global population distribution datasets.},

IWI is similar to the widely used wealth indices included in the Demographic and Health Surveys and UNICEF MICS surveys, but adds the property of comparability across place and time. IWI is based on data from 2.1 million households in 97 developing countries. With IWI we provide a stable and understandable yardstick for evaluating and comparing the situation of households, social groups and societies among all regions of the developing world. A household's ranking on IWI indicates to what extent the household possesses a basic set of assets, valued highly by people across the globe. IWI is tested thoroughly and turns out to be a stable index that hardly depends on the inclusion of specific items or on data for specific regions or time periods. National IWI values are highly correlated with human development, life expectancy, and national income, and IWI-based poverty measures with poverty headcount ratios.},

The subnational values of the four indicators were computed using data from statistical offices and from the Area Database of the Global Data Lab, which contains indicators aggregated from household surveys and census datasets. Values for missing years were estimated by interpolation and extrapolation from real data. By normalizing the population-weighted averages of the indicators to their national levels in the UNDP-HDI database, values of the SHDI and its dimension indices were obtained that at national level equal their official versions of the UNDP.},

The UCDP GED is an event dataset that disaggregates three types of organized violence (state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided violence) both spatially and temporally. Each event -- defined as an instance of organized violence with at least one fatality -- comes with date, geographical location, and identifiers that allow the dataset to be linked to and merged with other UCDP datasets. The first version of the dataset covers events of fatal violence on the African continent between 1989 and 2010. This article, firstly, introduces the rationale for the new dataset, and explains the basic coding procedures as well as the quality controls. Secondly, we discuss some of the data's potential weaknesses in representing the universe of organized violence, as well as some potential biases induced by the operationalizations. Thirdly, we provide an example of how the data can be used, by illustrating the association between cities and organized violence, taking population density into account. The UCDP GED is a useful resource for conflict analyses below the state and country-year levels, and can provide us with new insights into the geographical determinants and temporal sequencing of warfare and violence.},

To address this limitation, our present study developed a gridded material stocks dataset for China in Year 2000 and 2020, by examining the geographical distribution and geometric configurations of the human-made stock-containing environment. The stocks of twelve materials embodied in five end-use sectors and 104 products and constructions were assessed at a resolution of 1\,{\texttimes}\,1\,km grid. Material intensity in each product or construction component was carefully evaluated and tagged with its geometric conformation. The gridded stocks aggregately are consistent with the stock estimation across 337 prefectures and municipalities. The reliability of our assessment was also validated by previous studies from national, regional, to grid levels. This gridded mapping of material stocks may offer insights for urban-rural disparities, urban mining opportunity, and climate and natural disaster resilience.},

  abstract = {Disaggregated population counts are needed to calculate health, economic, and development indicators in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), especially in settings of rapid urbanisation. Censuses are often outdated and inaccurate in LMIC settings, and rarely disaggregated at fine geographic scale. Modelled gridded population datasets derived from census data have become widely used by development researchers and practitioners; however, accuracy in these datasets are evaluated at the spatial scale of model input data which is generally courser than the neighbourhood or cell-level scale of many applications. We simulate a realistic synthetic 2016 population in Khomas, Namibia, a majority urban region, and introduce several realistic levels of outdatedness (over 15 years) and inaccuracy in slum, non-slum, and rural areas. We aggregate the synthetic populations by census and administrative boundaries (to mimic census data), resulting in 32 gridded population datasets that are typical of LMIC settings using the WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained gridded population approach. We evaluate the cell-level accuracy of these gridded population datasets using the original synthetic population as a reference. In our simulation, we found large cell-level errors, particularly in slum cells. These were driven by the averaging of population densities in large areal units before model training. Age, accuracy, and aggregation of the input data also played a role in these errors. We suggest incorporating finer-scale training data into gridded population models generally, and WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained in particular (e.g., from routine household surveys or slum community population counts), and use of new building footprint datasets as a covariate to improve cell-level accuracy (as done in some new WorldPop-Global-Constrained datasets). It is important to measure accuracy of gridded population datasets at spatial scales more consistent with how the data are being applied, especially if they are to be used for monitoring key development indicators at neighbourhood scales within cities.},

The dataset is coded according to both the Correlates of War and the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) state lists, and is therefore compatible with a great number of existing databases in the discipline. Provided in a geographic data format, CShapes can be used directly with standard GIS software, allowing a wide range of spatial computations. In addition, we supply a CShapes package for the R statistical toolkit. This package enables researchers without GIS skills to perform various useful operations on the GIS maps. The paper introduces the CShapes dataset and structure and gives three examples of how to use CShapes in political science research. First, we show how results from quantitative analysis can be depicted intuitively as a map. The second application gives an example of computing indicators on the CShapes maps, which can then be used in statistical tests. Third, we illustrate the use of CShapes for generating different weights matrices in spatial statistical applications. All the examples can be replicated using the freely available R package and do not require specialized GIS skills. The dataset is available for download from the CShapes website (http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes).},

Despite progress, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level.

Rather than treating conflict as a direct consequence of ethnic cleavages, the authors argue that ethnicity per se does not affect civil war duration. Instead, its effect depends on its relationship to political institutions. They employ a dyadic approach that emphasizes the                political                context in which both government leaders and nonstate challengers can capitalize on the ascriptive nature of ethnicity. They show that although states can initially benefit from politicizing ethnic relations, once violent conflict breaks out, such policies may backfire on the government and make it difficult for incumbent governments to accept settlements that could terminate conflicts. Past policies of ethnic exclusion also benefit rebel organizations fighting the government, since the resulting grievances increase collective group solidarity and render individual fighters more cost tolerant. Using a new data set that codes the nexus between rebel organizations and ethnic groups, as well as information on ethnopolitical exclusion, the authors find considerable support for their propositions.},
